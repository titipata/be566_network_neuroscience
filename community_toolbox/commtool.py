    The optimal community structure is a subdivision of the network into

    edges and minimizes the number of between-group edges.
    This function is a fast an accurate multi-iterative generalization of the
    louvain community detection algorithm. This function subsumes and improves
    upon modularity_[louvain,finetune]_[und,dir]() and additionally allows to
    optimize other objective functions (includes built-in Potts Model i
    Hamiltonian, allows for custom objective-function matrices).

    ----------
    W : NxN np.array
        directed/undirected weighted/binary adjacency matrix
    gamma : float
        resolution parameter. default value=1. Values 0 <= gamma < 1 detect
        larger modules while gamma > 1 detects smaller modules.
        ignored if an objective function matrix is specified.
    ci : Nx1 np.arraylike
        initial community affiliation vector. default value=None
    B : str | NxN np.arraylike
        string describing objective function type, or provides a custom
        NxN objective-function matrix. builtin values
            'modularity' uses Q-metric as objective function
            'potts' uses Potts model Hamiltonian.
            'negative_sym' symmetric treatment of negative weights
            'negative_asym' asymmetric treatment of negative weights
    seed : int | None
        random seed. default value=None. if None, seeds from /dev/urandom.
